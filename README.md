#AMJ60
##Motivation of Uploading this Archive
This toolkit archive was got from ArmyGroup Corp. when I'm assembling my AMJ60.
ArmyGroup said the toolkit is provided by 杰少, the PCB vendor.
The origin way to get the AMJ60 firmware is to join 杰少 QQ group within this communication software.
I just uploaded this to any AMJ60 users on Github for your references.
